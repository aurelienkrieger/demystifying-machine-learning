# Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning models can be broadly categorized into different families based on their objectives and the types of tasks they are designed to solve.

1. Making Decisions (Classifiers):
  - Purpose: Teach the computer to make choices or categorize things.
  - Example: If you show it pictures of fruits, it can learn to distinguish between apples and oranges.

2. Predicting Values (Regression):
   - Purpose: Teach the computer to predict a number or value based on input.
   - Example: If you give it data about houses, it can predict the price of a new house.

3. Creating New Things (Generative Models):
   - Purpose: Teach the computer to generate new content that looks like what it learned.
   - Example: It can create new images or text that resemble the ones it was trained on.
