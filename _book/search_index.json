the creative potential of AI for critical & artistic projects\nCourse Description\nMachine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) open up a wide range of applications in the field of art and design, but also raise pressing questions and ethical dilemmas. This workshop provides a general introduction to AI/ML for people willing to use it in their creative practice. Applications we will discuss include facial or gesture recognition, sound analysis and generation, chatbots, and the generation of images from text descriptions for design or concept art.\nLearning Outcomes\n\nUnderstand the underlying concepts & techniques of Machine Learning\nGain an overview on the state of the art technologies, models and applications\nBreak down the technical and conceptual aspects of artistic works using AI/ML\nRun practical exercises to apply these methods\nDiscuss ethical dilemmas and develop critical thinking on the field\n\nSyllabus\nAgenda\nSession 1\nIntroduction to Machine Learning concepts. Demos & prototypes of classifiers & regression models for video & sound.\nSession 2\nStudy of workflow for interactive art. Demos & prototypes for text.\nSession 3\nIntroduction to generative models. Demos & prototypes with Stable Diffusion. Group discussions.\n"},"agenda/1-session1.html":{"url":"agenda/1-session1.html","title":"Session 1","keywords":"","body":"Session 1\n\nIntroductions\n\nPresentation of the objectives of the course\nGroup introduction with Miro board\n\n\nLecture: Introduction to Machine Learning\n\nbasic concepts & categories of models\nMediaPipe demos\ninspirations: video + sound\n\n\nFirst steps: Teachable Machine\n\ntrain an image classifier (classes: emotions)\ntrain an audio classifier (classes: colours)\n\n\nSetup of tools\n\nPrototyping - Video Classifiers\n\nintroduction to Transfer Learning\nuse MobileNet + ml5 to classify images.

The categories outlined are not necessarily exclusive, and many machine learning models can have functionalities that span multiple categories. The categorization is more about the primary purpose or task that a model is designed for.\n\nMaking Decisions (Classifiers):\n\nPurpose: Teach the computer to make choices or categorize things.\nExamples:\nObject classification: If you show it pictures of fruits, it can learn to distinguish between apples and oranges.\nSpeech Recognition: Recognize and transcribe spoken words.\nMusic Genre Classification: Classify music into different genres based on audio features.\n\n\n\n\nPredicting Values (Regression):\n\nPurpose: Teach the computer to predict continuous numbers based on input.\nExamples:\nIf you give it data about houses, it can predict the price of a new house.\nPose Estimation: Track facial landmarks for applications like augmented reality.\nObject Tracking: Follow the movement of specific objects in a video stream.\nAction Recognition: Recognize and track human activities in video sequences.\nSound Pitch Detection: Determine the frequency or pitch of a sound.\n\n\n\n\nNatural Language Processing (NLP):\n\nPurpose: Understand and generate human language.\nExamples:\nText Classification: Categorize text into predefined categories.\nNamed Entity Recognition: Identify entities (such as names, locations) in text.\nMachine Translation: Translate text from one language to another.\nChatbots: Interact with users in natural language, understanding queries and generating responses.\n\n\n\n\nCreating New Things (Generative Models):\n\nPurpose: Teach the computer to generate new content that looks like what it learned.\nExample: It can create new images or text that resemble the ones it was trained on.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  Credit: enjoyalgorithms.com\n\n\n"},"resources/references.html":{"url":"resources/references.html","title":"Inspirations","keywords":"","body":"References\nProjects\nText\n\nPartisan Thesaurus by Melanie Hoff\nproject page\narticle by FastCompany\n\n\nSemantic space of cartomancy by Allison Parrish\nproject page\nscreenshot\n\n\nThrough my eyes by Aurélien Krieger\nELIZA\nWikipedia page\ndemo\n\n\nCached experience\nIAgotchi by Rocio Berenguer\nLost in Computation by Jonas Eltes\nWriting with the machine by Robin Sloan\n\nVideo\n\nVFRAME project by Adam Harvey\nDFACE by Adam Harvey\nExposing.ai\nMás Que la Cara by Zach Lieberman\nFace Painter by Nahuel Gerth and Rudolfo Quintas\nFace Tetris by Lasse Korsgaard\nSignAll SDK: Sign language interface using MediaPipe is now available for developers\nArtificial Botany by fuse*\n\nSound\n\nSound-Controlled Wolfenstein 3D by Lasse Korsgaard & Andreas Refsgaard\n\nDemos\n\nml4a.net - Collection of Machine Learning resources for artists\nFaceOSC > MAX MSP (no ML)\nFaceOSC > Wekinator > Processing\nProcessing (webcam extractor) > Wekinator > Chunk (drum machine)\nWekinator Regressor test\nWekinator Classifier test\nPitch to zoom ml5.js\nCassify rock paper scissors ml5.js\nRegression musical mouse\nFeature extractor image regresssion\n\n"},"resources/tools.html":{"url":"resources/tools.html","title":"Tools","keywords":"","body":"Tools\nFor the workshop\n\nTeachable Machine\nVisual Studio Code\nVS Code - Live Server extension\nWekinator\nInvokeAI\nInvokeAI website\nInvokeAI official documentation\n\n\nEasy Diffusion\n\nReferences\n\nml5.js - Machine Learning on the web\nMedia Pipe Library\nml4a-ofx - collection of apps\nWekinator executable examples\nFaceOSC Kyle McDonald\nFaceOSC Gene Kogan\nYOLO\n\n"},"resources/readings.html":{"url":"resources/readings.html","title":"Readings","keywords":"","body":"Readings\n\nQu’est-ce que la vidéosurveillance algorithmique ?, 2022, La Quadrature du Net\nOpenAI Used Kenyan Workers on Less Than $2 Per Hour to Make ChatGPT Less Toxic, Billy Perrigo, 2023, TIME\nHumans Are Biased.
