The categories outlined are not necessarily exclusive, and many machine learning models can have functionalities that span multiple categories. The categorization is more about the primary purpose or task that a model is designed for.\n\nMaking Decisions (Classifiers):\n\nPurpose: Teach the computer to make choices or categorize things.\nExamples:\nObject classification: If you show it pictures of fruits, it can learn to distinguish between apples and oranges.\nSpeech Recognition: Recognize and transcribe spoken words.\nMusic Genre Classification: Classify music into different genres based on audio features.\n\n\n\n\nPredicting Values (Regression):\n\nPurpose: Teach the computer to predict continuous numbers based on input.\nExamples:\nIf you give it data about houses, it can predict the price of a new house.\nPose Estimation: Track facial landmarks for applications like augmented reality.\nObject Tracking: Follow the movement of specific objects in a video stream.\nAction Recognition: Recognize and track human activities in video sequences.\nSound Pitch Detection: Determine the frequency or pitch of a sound.\n\n\n\n\nNatural Language Processing (NLP):\n\nPurpose: Understand and generate human language.\nExamples:\nText Classification: Categorize text into predefined categories.\nNamed Entity Recognition: Identify entities (such as names, locations) in text.\nMachine Translation: Translate text from one language to another.\nChatbots: Interact with users in natural language, understanding queries and generating responses.\n\n\n\n\nCreating New Things (Generative Models):\n\nPurpose: Teach the computer to generate new content that looks like what it learned.\nExample: It can create new images or text that resemble the ones it was trained on.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  Credit: enjoyalgorithms.com\n\n\n"},"resources/references.html":{"url":"resources/references.html","title":"Inspirations","keywords":"","body":"References\nProjects\nText\n\nPartisan Thesaurus by Melanie Hoff\nproject page\narticle by FastCompany\n\n\nSemantic space of cartomancy by Allison Parrish\nproject page\nscreenshot\n\n\nThrough my eyes by Aurélien Krieger\nELIZA\nWikipedia page\ndemo\n\n\nCached experience\nIAgotchi by Rocio Berenguer\nLost in Computation by Jonas Eltes\nWriting with the machine by Robin Sloan\n\nVideo\n\nVFRAME project by Adam Harvey\nDFACE by Adam Harvey\nExposing.ai\nMás Que la Cara by Zach Lieberman\nFace Painter by Nahuel Gerth and Rudolfo Quintas\nFace Tetris by Lasse Korsgaard\nSignAll SDK: Sign language interface using MediaPipe is now available for developers\nArtificial Botany by fuse*\n\nSound\n\nSound-Controlled Wolfenstein 3D by Lasse Korsgaard & Andreas Refsgaard\n\nDemos\n\nml4a.net - Collection of Machine Learning resources for artists\nFaceOSC > MAX MSP (no ML)\nFaceOSC > Wekinator > Processing\nProcessing (webcam extractor) > Wekinator > Chunk (drum machine)\nWekinator Regressor test\nWekinator Classifier test\nPitch to zoom ml5.js\nCassify rock paper scissors ml5.js\nRegression musical mouse\nFeature extractor image regresssion\n\nTools\n\nml5.js - Machine Learning on the web\nMedia Pipe Library\nml4a-ofx - collection of apps\nWekinator executable examples\nFaceOSC Kyle McDonald\nFaceOSC Gene Kogan\nYOLO\n\nReadings\n\nFace tracking of black people\nPreducting police\nFrance Olympic Games\n\n"}}}
